<h1> Project Euler Solutions and Outtakes (C) </h1>

The following repo holds solutions to the Project Euler problems that I have solved. It contains most methods to get the answer from brute force, to highly optimized beyond the scope of differences in big O between algorithms. Libraries concatenated from methods used in solutions are made available in the src/custom_lib directory. Please don't take advantage of the solutions provided without having solved the problems first, this repo is supposed to represent a place to pull from when working on similary problems in the future, don't rob yourself of the educational value of solving the problems on your own. 

<b> Completed Problems: </b>
<ul>
  <li> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20 </li>
</ul>

<b> Custom Libraries: </b>
<ul>
    <li> int_arrays: an api for working with arrays of signed integers where the first index is the length (see header in file) </li>
    <li> math: miscellaneous math functions (see header in file) </li>
</ul>
